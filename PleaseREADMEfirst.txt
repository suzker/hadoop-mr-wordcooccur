README

Three Mapper Reducer programs: wordcount, pair and stripe, are all integrated in one jar file: "mrWordCooccur_fatjar.jar". (don't get fooled by the name... sorry).

As mentioned in the report, the mr task type can be controlled by the input argument of the jar file:
>> bin/hadoop jar ~/mrWordCooccurrence.jar [input-folder] [output-folder] [task]
Task can be either one of “wordcount”, “pair” or “stripe”.

Thank you!
